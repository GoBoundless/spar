        %h3 Why SPAR?

        %p 
          Single-page web-apps add significant complexity to development: the front-end becomes it's own MVC-like application, requiring mature code organization, build systems, and dev-environment harnesses. SPAR is an opinionated framework that aims to ease single-page web-app development by addressing the major challenges:

        %ul
          %li Asset organization
          %li Compilation pipeline
          %li Build & deployment support

        %p
          Additionally, SPAR provides templates & example projects for either a bare-bones project, or one with some of favorite tools pre-included.
          
        %p
          Under the hood, SPAR is a Rails-derived project, taking advantage of the powerful asset-pipeline, while stripping out legacy web-app support and introducing tools & patterns specific to single-page apps
