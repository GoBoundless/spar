// This is a manifest file that'll be compiled into application.css, which will include all the files
// listed below.

// Any CSS and SASS file within this directory or vendor/stylesheets can be referenced here using a relative path.

// You're free to add application-wide styles to this file and they'll appear at the top of the
// compiled file, but it's generally better to create a new file per style scope.
